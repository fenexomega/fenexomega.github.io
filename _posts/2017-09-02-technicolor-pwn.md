Technicolor TD5336 Pwned
======

Hello world! How are you today?

Yesterday I arrived home from work, after a week of training and studing web app pentest. Can't say I didn't learn a lot of things, and trained as well. Then, I realized it was friday. I Didn't feel like drinking or hanging out, so I did what few people do on a friday night: I **hacked** some shit. :^)

Well, like anything people do, I began looking for a target to focus on. And my target the **technicolor TD5336 router**, which you can find info about it [here](http://www.technicolor.com/en/solutions-services/connected-home/broadband-devices/telco-gateways/td336). This guy seems cool enough for me to have a little fun on a friday night. So, fasten your seat belts kiddo, here we go.


First and above all, I did a port scan on the router. Saw the telnet port open, so did a connection to it with the default credentials (that would be **admin:admin**).
